Reading *the Blacks of Premodern China*

This book is written by Wyatt. Here are some reading responses to his book.

It seems the author misunderstands some classical Chinese. He makes a pair of mistakes in his translations, though generally it does not affect our understanding. However, several of them are quite misleading, especially in the text of Molin (磨邻) in the New Tang History. It says “其君臣七日一休，不出纳交易，饮以穷夜。”, which clearly means its king and officials have a rest every seven DAYS. But in the interpretation of the author, it is described as “Ramadan” in the 7th month of the lunar calendar, which largely changes the original meaning and adds an Arabic color that may not be contained in the text.These words are of great importance and should not be wrongly interpreted since they directly tell us the inhabitants and traditions of this group of people, on whom we are now doing a research. 

Aside from that, it also lacks the evidence which can convince us that the names from the ancient books are actually those the author mentions in Africa nowadays. “Bobali” being Berbera is somehow understandable, according to the similarity of their pronunciations, while “Luoposi” also referring to Berbera seems not so convincing. At least it is still controversial, some scholars even maintaining this place belongs to Australia. However, in the latter part of this chapter, the description and inference of the recording details of Zheng He’s journey are very excellent.
