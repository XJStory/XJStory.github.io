## Linduff Sun's *Gender and Chinese Archaeology*

Composed of twelve separate research papers, this book presents new findings in the study of gender in Chinese archaeology from the Neolithic Age to the Han Dynasty with detailed charts and tables. This book has been a pioneer in gender study, in the context of Chinese archaeology, with several pioneering features. Before this book, gender study had not been an independent research topic in such a field in China. Meanwhile, the mechanical use of Marxist social theory made the study of gender ignored for decades. As the author points out, Chinese archaeologists knew little about interpretive theory, including gender theory. In these areas, papers listed in this book make certain breakthroughs.

With regard to the sources, this book emphasizes on physical materials rather than literary sources. The literary record often does not fully reflect the details of historical issues, such as exogamy in the Shang Dynasty. This relies on the detailed examination of burial objects and records. This is the most important condition for the selection of materials in this book, which focuses heavily on the use of evidence among funerary settings, such as visual imagery, burial patterns, and burial goods.  

At the same time, it is worth noting that the book’s discussion includes not only the geographic or political central part, but also remote areas of China such as the northwest and northeast, as well as non-royal families, such as herdsmen.

This book has much to commend it as a seminal work. However, it could still be more inclusive in its approach to Chinese heirloom literature, which served as a powerful system of traditional Chinese historiography. Misunderstanding could also happen if we only use physical material as a starting point for inferences. To this day, Chinese scholars continue to argue fiercely about the authenticity of the existence of the Xia dynasty because of the disparity between documentary and physical evidence.  Perhaps we can offer a more tolerant solution to such archaeological problems. Anyway, there is still some space for us to discuss how to combine Chinese heirloom texts with excavated stuff in the archaeological practice.
