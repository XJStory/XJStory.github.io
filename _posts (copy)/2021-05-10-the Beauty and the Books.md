## Widmer’s *the Beauty and the Books*

This book gives nice case studies to show the extraordinary female authors who wrote novels or prose in an early period. Widmer is good at making assumptions, many of which are convincing, but still some lack substantial evidence. For example, while some books do not survive, she believes they functioned as to support her arguments,  without examining their possible content, e.g. Mingyuan wenwei 名媛文纬 (Canon of prose by famous women). 

She also analyses very well the motivations of such women writers to create literary works. But I personally think it would be better if digging into the textual sources deeper. Especially, those written for the pride or “vanity” of family. Different from novels, poems from guige 闺阁 were of course restricted to writing good morality because they were censored by the male family members (in many cases, by their fathers). Thus, we should make it clear, to how much extent can we view these poems as the voice of the female, and what are the distinctions from male’s poems that written for family reputation. Due to the lack of textual analysis, it is not very convincing to see the increasing number of such a category as the rise of subjective writing of women.

But Widmer does it well in the later chapters when talking about the novel Honglou meng ying. She analyses the authors’ narrative specialty, such as speaking for women’s interests and infusing an autobiographical story into the work. Paola Zamperini does the same work to find the male view (or masculinary view, using her term) in the novels writing about courtesans, which are mostly written by men.  It inspires us to emphasize more on the internal textual analysis, to feel the true voice of women. I believe that in-depth textual analysis can better construct male or female narrative patterns as well as value orientations. For example, when it comes to those debates like the sex of the author of Chi po zi zhuan 痴婆子传 (Biography of a Foolish Woman),  we can distinguish the male perspective from the female in this way.
