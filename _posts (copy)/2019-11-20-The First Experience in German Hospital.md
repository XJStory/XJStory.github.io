> This small article tells my 5-days experience in Hautklink in Heidelberg.

Perhaps because of the big stress of the exams, I got severe Zoster, which was quite painful! The day after my exam, i went to the Hautklinik (the skin clinic)for emergency treatment. The doctor suggested that I should stay in hospital for 5 days. Immediately, i fetched my clothing and washing staff, and then started my “hospital trip”.

The environment there is suitable for patients who are in need of recovery. I shared a big room with an old man who was suffering from cancer and several skin operations. All day long silence made me peaceful, as if a Buddhist was living in the temple. But my movement was limited that i could not go beyond the klink area which is somewhat narrow. If one stays longer in this kind of atmosphere, he may gradually fall into the trouble of deep depression. 

What i should do was getting the transfusion, taking the tablet, and of course lying and sleeping. With the modern equipment and advanced skills of the nurses, I was fine with my sickness, freely getting up and moving my hand without feeling much pain. The majority of the Krankenschwestern was female, only one man. All of them were rich of experience (that means there were no beautiful young ladies), well responsible for patients.

Bread, sausage, with butter and cheese, these were the main menu of everyday food. The typical German style was not that attractive to me, to be honest. But thanking to my classmates who brought me some Chinese food, I did enjoy some different tastes. In the afternoon, we were all served with coffee and tea. All I needed to do was just to lie in bed, sometimes sitting up when food came.

I felt good care, and my body recovered smoothly. In five days, i got better and better, the doctor finally gave me a letter after checking my blood. The virus was gone, and I still needed to take the medicine for 4 weeks, during which I should go to my Hausarzt to get some examination again.

To conclude, the place was quite but made me feel a little lonely. I lived with my computer and books for 5 days. But living in the fast pace of everyday life, I do believe such an opportunity has inspired me much on this question how should we human beings live our lives. There is much that we should think about.
