## Book review
I’ll give a conclusion of this book, Toxic Archipelago. First, let’s go through all the chapters, to have an overlook of the whole book. Also, for us to remember all the case studies throughout this book.

In Chapter One, The Agency of Insects, he examines the actions of humans and insects, in which four case studies are offered (Japanese beetle, the tachinid fly, silkworms and mosquitoes) to depict environmental changes and their unintended outcomes. 

Chapter 2 investigates the associated health impacts of insecticides, particularly the organophosphate parathion. chapter 2 considers the effects of insecticides, from the rather innocent application of whale oil used during the Edo period to the horriﬁc introduction of lead and arsenic during the Meiji and the massive use of the chemical parathion in the twentieth century;

Chapter 6: Catastrophes of Collieries (Houjou and Honkeiko)
In Chapter Six, Hell at the Hojo Colliery, Walker examines a deadly coal mine explosion in 1914. The very verticality of the mine, both in the physical structure (new technologies had permitted construction of increasingly deep shafts) and in its hierarchical but fragmented management, magnified the tragedy of the fire, which eventually claimed 687 lives. Once again, Walker weaves different narrative threads into a cohesive whole – from coal’s importance in fueling the Meiji war-making and industrialization efforts to the engineering intricacies of the mines themselves –

Chapter 5: Minamata DiseaseMercury
Chisso produced many of the chemical inputs that enabled Japan’s early industrialization, but also had a side effect. It is culture that matters, mercury’s toxicity caused strong damage in the fishing communities surrounding Minamata Bay due to the their local diet, which consists of fish and shell.

Chapter 3:Cooper mining and ecological collapse 1900s.
Tokugawa technologies (the most important in Tokugawa mining was the development of haibuki, or “cupellation smelting”) and Ashio Copper Mine
the river had changed and the fish were dying

In chapter 3, Copper Mining and Ecological Collapse, Walker moves to the industrialization processes that characterized the Meiji period. That industrialization, driven in large part by Japan’s growing military ambitions in the region, demanded metals. Chapter Three explores the Ashio mine complex, responsible for producing two metals so central to Japan’s modernization: silver, and later copper. Walker details how the mine was embedded not only in regional and global geopolitics as early as the 17th century, but also in the adjacent Watarase River watershed, the rice paddies downstream that were watered by the river, and the human and non-human communities connected to those paddies. Walker again underscores interconnectedness and system dynamics 

Chapter 4 Millitary Economies and the Kamioka zinc mine
Jinzuu river  "it-hurts it-hurts disease" (Itai-itai disease) caused by Cadmium
Walker recounts the story of the well-known industrial disease incidents 
Walker argues that the causes are far more complex. He makes his most eloquent case for hybrid causation –  that is, for the need to understand not only the biophysical aspects of toxins and disease, but also the socio-cultural and historic-geographic context –  in his explanation of Itai-Itai (it hurts, it hurts) disease. Women, adhering to cultural norms prescribing white skin as beautiful, shielded themselves from the sun and were therefore deficient in Vitamin D (a key building block for strong bones), and were therefore more susceptible to the bone brittleness and breaking caused by cadmium ingestion.

There are also some cases in other parts of the book. for example, the asbestos-related diseases in Amagasaki 尼崎, which were caused by Asbestos石棉. Those who have breathed in this substance will easily get cancer or pulmonary disease肺病. It only influenced the miners, but also normal people. Because of it was widely applied to building, the pollution broke out when earthquakes happened in Japan. 

Yokkaichi Asthma 四日市ぜんそく occurred in the city of Yokkaichi in 1960s. The burning of petroleum and crude oil released large quantities of sulfur oxide that caused severe smog, resulting in severe cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma among the local inhabitants.

Causation of Pollution
Toxic Archipelago offers a unique view of the history of industrial diseases in Japan by exploring the relationship between man, industrialization and the environment. The author, Brett L. Walker, rejects reductionist or single explanations for what he terms our ‘current environmental mess’, instead he argues for a ‘hybrid causation model’ (p. xiii) as the key to understanding environmental and health impacts. The knowledge, for example, that exposure to heavy metals causes ill health, or unregulated mining practices generate a degraded and polluted landscape, is too narrow in its explanation and it is necessary to examine all human activities, from the political through to the cultural. It is a combination of these drivers that generated demand for a particular substance; facilitated its production and its usage, and its subsequent disposal; resulting in a domino effect, or a web of causation, that becomes manifest in an unhealthy environment and ultimately bodily pain and suffering.

Reaction(brief introduction)
This book provides a platform that offers readers a multi-dimensional view of one of the many tragedies that has come to symbolize the collateral damage of Japan’s industrialization.

Conclusion:       
his main argument is that human’s liberation from nature is a fantasy of modernization
he focuses on the relationship between human, industrialization and the environment.

For many in Japan, argues Walker, the rapid quest for industrialization was a symbol of progress, innovation, and modernity. For many others, it meant exploitative work conditions, pollution-induced health problems, human disfigurement through workplace accidents, long-term pain and suffering from incurable diseases, and the passing on of diseases to the innocent next generation. Life in Japan was for many a kind of hell on earth.

Pain as a commication of nature. (Chemicals for suiside)
Pain, the author contends, links us to nature and is a marker of destruction, both of the environment and a destroyed body. The relationship between the state and pain is a central theme that runs through the text. Walker teases out the historical nature of the relationship between the Japanese and their toxic environment in six chapters that explore a variety of environments and systems. Within these engineered spaces he traces the events and circumstances that combined to create pain and suffering.

Toxicity was an inevitable outcome of cultural innovations that viewed nature as a resource waiting to be exploited toward useful human ends. 

In conclusion, Toxic Archipelago makes an excellent addition to any course on environmental issues in Japan. Walker has carefully researched, thoughtfully rendered accounts of industrial disease in Japan make clear that, far from liberating us from nature, modern technology has instead tightened the binds between us and the world we inhabit.The book is substantially referenced, deftly grounded in the historiography and illustrated with black and white images, tables and charts. The structure of the monograph makes it possible to dip into the text.

However, here comes some critiques (some are collected from Internet).
Political ecologists working along the disciplinary edges of geography and anthropology (as well as in other fields) have for decades sought to explain human-environment interactions, especially regarding environmental degradation and resultant human distress, as embedded in complex causal webs undergirded by a global political economic system in much the same way Walker tells the story of industrial poisoning in Japan. As a scholarly project, political ecology will benefit from Walker’s insights into Japan; political ecological work in East Asia to date has been fairly limited.  

Walker fails to deﬁne what he means by the term “industrial disease,” which appears in his book’s subtitle. As I understand his approach, he perhaps means to address through this term all sorts of diseases resulting from various forms of  industrial disasters occurring within mines and factories or in the wild. I would endorse this broad use of the term. But  so far, the term has mainly been used in a more restricted sense,as a synonym of occupational disease. Whynot,then,mention also the diseases that have affected those who work in the industries presented here? For example,  in the last chapter, on the coal mine explosion at Hojo, I wish the author had given some more information on carbon monoxide intoxication. We know that it killed some members of the rescue team, but it may have also subjected some survivors of the explosion to tremendous suffering. Such prolonged exposure can sometimes be worse than an immediate death.
