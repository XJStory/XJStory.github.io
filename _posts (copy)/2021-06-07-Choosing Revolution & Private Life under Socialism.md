## Helen Praeger Young's *Choosing Revolution*

The contents of *Choosing Revolution* can be briefly summarised as: interviews with a small group of women who lived through the Long March and research of this oral history. Twenty-two interviewees were selected for this book, and the recordings of the interviews were translated and processed into a book. The interviewees gave as much detail as possible about their experiences of the Long March, their personal backgrounds and so on. A feature of this book is that it is heavy on narrative and light on argument.

The study of oral history is very different from textual analysis. The subjective nature of the research subject is always a problem. In Young's approach, it makes sense to reduce the impact of this by varying the questioning strategy in order to get as much truth as possible. Meanwhile, the author also notes the different understandings of the same concept between each interviewee. The title "Choose Revolution" clearly suggests a kind of agency for the women. When asked the reason for joining the Long March, most said they were "participating in the revolution", with various specific explanations. Everyone understands and imagines revolution in different ways that depend on their birth, financial situation, education level, etc. This is an important support to show the complexity of history, the diversity of characters and dissolve the simple categorisation of women (the heroic tale).

## YAN Yunxiang's Private Life under Socialism

Another book, *Private Life under Socialism*, argues that the socialist state played a key role in transforming the private lives of villagers in Xiajia. The author has conducted the examination over many years in the manner of fieldwork common to anthropological research. 

The exploration of themes such as public events, marriage and family, leads to the conclusion that the situation of egotism and the “uncivil individual” are expanding in the post-collective era. Accompanying the author's arguments is a very detailed account that is compelling. The author is very careful in his selection of material and will note things that others have told him and that he himself has not witnessed. He looks at many changes at the political and personal level, such as changes in the organisation and form of politics, modification in legal texts, and even the use of new vocabulary. Overall, his method and materials provide good support for his assertions.

One thing that might still be taken into concern is the representativeness of this case. The author claims that he does not intend to extend this case to a full picture of all rural China as a whole.Yet it's easy to make the connection. I guess that the north-east (Manchuria), as a special region (including not only Japanese colonial rule but also the history of ethnic minorities before it, and the migration element), is particularly special and might not be that traditional patriarchal. The author could also have devoted one chapter to the various features of this area before 1949.
