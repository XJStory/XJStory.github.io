# **Some Features of the Hero Description in Novels of the Early Period of the DPRK:** Taking the example of &quot;Fellow Travellers&quot;

Jia XIE

**Abstract** : Literature cannot be analyzed without setting it back to a particular background. North Korean novels in the 1950-60s were with salient features which will be discussed in this paper in terms of the way heroes were constructed. Meanwhile, a brief comparative study on the DDR and the PRC will be mentioned in the latter part.

**Keywords** : Literature, Fellow Travellers, North Korea, Juche Ideology

### **Introduction**

As World War II ended in the 1940s, the main powers in the world went into two camps that formed the Cold War pattern. Correspondingly, the literature tendency on both sides appeared very different. In the Socialist countries, no matter in the DPRK, PRC, or DDR, the literary works in different languages had the homogeneous theme and similar writing styles. Novels were composed by the socialist writers to express their thought and perception of the newly-established states. The features of these works are obvious, constituting the mutual literary memory of that age in the socialist countries.

Since a long time, this type of novels had been underestimated by literary scholars as of a low quality or of poor value of art. In the comparatively new researches, scholars have begun to pay attention to rediscovering this unappreciated part in the world literature history. Alexander Saechtig focuses on the prose written in the DDR and PRC between the 50s and early 70s to examine the outer-text factors and the hero presentation in the narrative text.

 Literature in the DPRK in the 1950s has certain comparability with that in the PRC and DDR for they were all the reflection of the respective situation where a new Socialist government newly began after a war. North Korean novels have their own characteristics while sharing some similarities with Chinese and German ones. With a transcultural approach, the research on North Korean literature can beneficially enrich the comparative and world literary theory.

### **North Korean Novels in the 1950s and 60s**

Immediately after the liberation from Japanese colonization in 1945, Koreans were dedicated to building an entirely independent nation. Efforts like the purification of Korean script seemed to lead to a break from the classical literature. To pick up the traditional one again, the North Koreans began to revise and translate the classics written in _hanmun_. It was part of the independent process and they did value the literary heritage of former time, but meanwhile many of the former writers were defined as exploiters who had been the ruling class before. The North Korean novels turned into a unique direction in the 1950-60s.

In the English academic sphere, studies on North Korean novels were a dessert before the 90s. In 1994, Brian Myer published his book &quot;Han Sŏrya and the North Korean literature&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;the failure of socialist realism in the DPRK&quot;, claiming the inferiority of North Korean canonical writing by comparing Han&#39;s work to classics of Soviet Union.

 On the contrary, Tatiana Gabroussenko&#39;s work &quot;Soldiers on the Cultural Front&quot; in 2010 arrived at the conclusion that socialist realism was successful in North Korea.

Influenced by the Soviet literature mode, the so-called socialist realism style usually contains these dimensions: relevant and understandable to the workers, describing common people, and supporting the aim of the party.

 Overemphasized political nature surpassed any other characteristics. In the 1950s, as Kim Il-Sung put forward the Juche Ideology, this national philosophy had an impact on every aspect of the state. In 1957, the first &quot;Chollima Movement&quot; started. Combining the Marxist literary guidance and the Juche spirit, Literature in the DPRK demonstrated its uniqueness. Themes of literature covered all the socialist propaganda which can display the superiority of socialism and encourage people to join in the socialist reform, asides from that, anti-South literature was also a tendency. Moreover, the party writers were a main group of writing, including Kim Byong-hun, Han Sol-ya, Lee Gi-yeong, and so on who were essential members of the party.

### **The Depiction of Hero in &quot;Fellow Travellers&quot;**

Fellow Travellers (길동무들), written by Kim Byong-hun in 1960, shortly after the first five-year plan of the DPRK, is a typical novel under the aesthetics of Juche ideology. The author, Kim, himself was born and educated on the peninsula during the Japanese occupation and later elected as the chairman of the General Federation of Korean Literature and Art and the candidate of the Central Committee, in short words, an important member of the communist party of the DPRK. A writer&#39;s production is tightly associated with his identity. Standing at this position, Kim devoted his effort into the literary creation fully following the instruction of the central leaders. On the other hand, after the Korean war, both north and south were on the rubble, everything in need of reconstruction. The literary works encouraging to construct perfectly met the need of the situation.

This novel &quot;Fellow Travellers&quot; tells a story that &quot;I&quot; meet a girl who holds a can of carp egg on the train. The whole plots mainly centered on the conversation between this girl and &quot;me&quot; and an emergency where she leaves the can on the train. Finally, the girl&#39;s secret is told, which is to promote the potential fish industry to the whole village and even the county. It is a work full of political color, vividly shown from many parts, such as the narrator&#39;s role as chairman of a county, and the socialist dream of industrial prosperity. The text is not long, but clearly display the author&#39;s image of his country at that time, by applying a useful writing method of creating a heroic character.

Heroines are highly praised in a wide range of literary works in the DPRK. In &quot;Fellow Travellers&quot;, the author sets a girl as the main role on purpose. Through the text where she carries the complete equipment of fish breeding, an image of female proletariat shows up in readers&#39; mind. She is not only a common person but also the one who dedicates herself into socialist construction. In terms of describing this kind of image, it plays little role in the gender issue. According to Marxist thought, women should be involved in fighting against capitalism. Both men and women are revolutionaries. However, in the Korean traditional idea, women are supposed to obey the Confucian virtue and later expected to be &quot;a good wife and wise mother&quot; under the imperial invasion.

 To examine the classic women roles in the literary works in the Joseon period, their merits are usually related to wisdom, such as Bakssi in &quot;Bakssijeon (박씨전朴氏傳)&quot;
[7](#sdfootnote7anc)
 , and filial piety, such as Simcheong in &quot;Simcheongjeon (심쳥젼沈淸傳)&quot;, or the sought to love like &quot;The Story of Chunhyang&quot;. Different from all the women images in the traditional literature, Myong-suk represents an independent being, neither subordinated to men nor seeking true love. She excels not at wisdom or virtue, but a firm resolution to contribute to the socialist cause.

The feature of anti-tradition can be found in the aesthetic value as well. As portrayed in the novel, the girl, Myong-suk, is young and enthusiastic, while her appearance is with a black face, trim-fitting dress, and canvas shoes. No words directly mention her beautiful out-looking, contrary to the stories of the Joseon period. The repeating story of gifted scholars and beautiful ladies ended. In other words, North Korean novels focused more on mental beauty or ideological beauty rather than physical beauty. Aesthetics is basically a principle of perception, which is centered on human beings. The subject of recognizing beauty is people. Under the Juche Ideology, man (_ingan_) is the most beautiful.

 When man follows the national, moral, and political demands, he or she is presented with charm. On the other hand, Myong-suk&#39;s self-reliance provides the readers with a sensate recognition of positive emotion when it is serving the social community and obeying the Juche spirit. She is a student graduated from the university and has the options of all the chances of jobs, but she decides to work for her village which differs from her dream in the childhood of integrating into big cities. The author praised this behavior, which is tightly connected with the policy of the Workers&#39; Party of Korea.

Furthermore, the main characters in the novels come from a common family, instead of a higher class. There is no Yangbang anymore, who played a big part in traditional novels. Because the aim of Marxism was to eliminate the asymmetries between classes, the lower-class people could debut as the main objects in the literary world. Myths and legendaries were out of masses, but it changed when the role of the hero became a peasant. None of the class, authority, or capital matters in the description of commoner hero in these North Korean novels. The hero is only a common one but with a high comprehension of Juche ideology that can be an example to imitate.

The so-called hero is not with the noble meaning in this case. In the text of &quot;Fellow Travellers&quot;, the writer says by Myong-suk&#39;s words that heroism should be avoided. Heroism was somewhat contradictory to the big environment of collectivism in the DPRK. Nevertheless, the nation and the new government still needed heroes to play the role of appealing to the public to devote for socialism. Thus, creating unheroic heroes was the main tool in literary writing, who were imagined to be with the perfect sacrificing idea and the understanding of patriotism.

### **&quot;Aufbauliterature&quot; and &quot;Seventeen-Years Literature&quot;**

Looking throughout the states that had a similar experience, the literary trend parallelly shares some specific features. The discourse about the literature of them has lasted for decades. Although its definition still controversial, the term &quot;Socialist Realism&quot; can roughly refer to the writing method under the party lines and the literature appearance in the Socialist countries. The writing methods and the way of constructing heroes can be comparatively analyzed.

In the DDR, the literature of the 1950s has been categorized as &quot;Aufbauliterature&quot;, literarily meaning &quot;construction literature&quot;. It was like the North Korean party writers&#39; style, most of the attributes of the novels serving the national ideology. For example, &quot;Menschen an unserer Seite&quot; shows the revolutionary possibilities of socialist construction through the initiative and creativity of the workers. In the novel, the main figures that been illustrated are worker class, and the petty-bourgeois becoming a dangerous enemy. The style of Aufbauliteratur in the DDR was under the Marxist idea and focused much on the workers.

Peasants were the most common leading roles in the Chinese narrative. To refer to the period between the establishment of the new China in 1949 and the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1967, the term &quot;Seventeen-Years Literature&quot; has been mostly agreed by scholars of Chinese modern and contemporary literature in the PRC. Chinese people were of great enthusiasm for building a brand-new state. Several books written by peasant-born writers came out and became well-known for a time, regarded as &quot;red classics&quot; by the readers later. The famous writers like Zhao Shuli, led an influential literary school named &quot;Potato school&quot;, whose chinoiserie touched the common peasants and spread widely.

### **Conclusion**

The former studies tended to ignore the particular time and circumstance where the literary works of the DPRK emerged. North Korean novels in the 1950-60s recorded the sensate experience of the intellectuals after witnessing the imperial invasion, civil war, and the new state, though full of political aims and lacked in art value. Influenced by the Soviet model, North Korean literature began a unique road on the novels writing. To depict the heroes in the socialist reform, the party writers carefully set the roles in the novels, taking the roles&#39; background, appearance, class, and the aspiration to the party into consideration. These novels show some anti-tradition and anti-Confucius spirit while following the policy of the Workers&#39; Party of Korea.

The accurate term &quot;Aufbauliterature&quot; can be applied to the literary tendency in all three countries (that are the DRPK, DDR, and PRC) in the early period after their establishment. To make a comparison, all of them are the collective memory of one generation after the big wars. However, excessively involving in politics made them for a long time drop into a stillness. More observation and reading by the latter readers are continuously in need.
