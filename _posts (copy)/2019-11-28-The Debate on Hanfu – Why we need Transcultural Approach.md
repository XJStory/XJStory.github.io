title: The Debate on Hanfu – Why we need Transcultural Approach
categories: [日思]

> Today, a piece of news on the Chinese social media caught my attention. It says that a couple were refused to get the marriage certificate by the local government department because they had taken their photo in Hanfu (Chinese traditional clothing), which was judged as “informal” for an official certificate. They had to change the photo in the Western suit finally.

A fierce debate happened immediately among the netizens. The biggest questions were as following: Is Hanfu Chinese traditional clothing? Why is Western-style suit formal while Hanfu informal? Does this situation mean the surrender into western culture?

**Hanfu – the clothing of Chinese Ethnic?**

As the Hanfu fans explain, Hanfu can refer to all the variations of clothing during all the feudal dynasties over 2000 years. However, this difinition is way far away from acuracy. What a countryman wore in the Confucius age is certainly different from the rich’s clothing in Ming dynasty – it usually depends on the classes of individuals, the time period, and maybe the fashion. What Hanfu advocaters pursue now is only the nice-looking ones, which should not be blamed excessively. However, how can Hanfu thus be a representative of Chinese traditional wearing? Just same with the Scottish kilt, Hanfu is a recently-made “invented tradition” whose concept did not exist before at all. 

**Should a nation hold its own clothing?**

Hanfu fails to be a real traditional object, but there is another problem, that is “do Chinese need Hanfu, since other nations have their ones and are still wearing the often daily, such as Kimono, or Ao dai?”. It is quite hard to answer. Nowadays, we human beings are trapped into the dilemma of “building nation”. Nation is a modern concept which is different from either race or ethnic to a big degree, and national state is now the dominant institution of the world where everyone emphasizes “nation”. A nation is supposed to be homogenous, opposed to the multility of culture. That is why I say nation is built. Taking Japanese Wafuku as an example, the formation of its concept was a product against Youfu (Western Clothing). Let us think, is the clothing which people wore before Nara period also Wafuku? 

**Is every part of the world becoming the same?**

This question is already related to a key point of transcultural studies. To deal with it, we should have an idea of modernity. Nowadays, the world is on the way of modernization, urbanization, industrialization, and etc.. Are these processes equal to Westernization, when they originated from the west? To be honest, it can hardly be discussed comprehensively in such a blog article. I would recommend SN Eisenstadt’s work Multiple Modernities, and Monica Juneja’s talk on transcultural theory to everyone who is interested in this topic. Now that we are all in the early period of this process, transcultural studies offer a perspective where we can focus on the dynamics and interactions among cultures which in the past were seen as closed with clear boundaries. In other words, studying transculture is to some extent to challenge the established notions of national, ethnic, and disciplinary categories.
