## Evans' *The Subject of Gender*


This is an excellent academic work by a good scholar. It touches a point that has been neglected for long, the mother-daughter relationship. Through interviews with women of various ages and backgrounds who are daughters, mothers, or other female family identities, this study shows some shared memories of the last several decades and the transformations of the relationship between two generations. As the author suggests, this book is not reconstructing a true history out of oral narrations, but rather examining how the pasts these daughters percepted affected their lives. It is a good example of studying subjective history. Refining and theorizing these interviewees' commonplace narratives, and building arguments and frameworks, was the most enlightening part of the book for me.

The book is divided into several chapters, each with a specific theme, such as separation, sex, filial piety, etc. At the end of each chapter there is a large section of notes to explain some special terms and to cite and introduce previous research, which makes the chapters full and well argued. A very worthwhile point to learn is that the authors are very detailed about the different contexts. Under each topic, there are introductions to the time background, policies, and also cultural traditions, allowing readers who are not familiar with this history or China to quickly grasp her arguments.

In addition, the presentation of some Chinese-ised concept makes the arguments in this book fascinating. It captures the feature of the Chinese mother-daughter relationship in a specific context of the time. For instance, the term “goutong”, rather than common communication, is at all times reminding readers that it is a new language of communication that has been taken up by women to describe their mother-daughter relationships since the 1980s.
