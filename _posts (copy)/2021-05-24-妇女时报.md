## Poems of Republican Ladies — a case study in _FNSB_ (_Funüshibao_)

As Judge points out, _FNSB,_ with the significant feature of materiality and cosmopolitanism, aims at shaping the &quot;Republican Lady&quot;, neither boudoirs (_guixiu_闺秀) nor new women (_xinnüxing_新女性). Judge emphasises the publicness of this newly-emerging female group in the early twentieth century. Both Edwards and Judge observe that the feminist movement of that time was very closely aligned with the political movement to overthrow the aotucracy of the Qing government. All these features are reflected in the women&#39;s writings in this periodical.

In contrast to the other book (_Women and the Periodical Press in China&#39;s Long Twentieth Century_), _Republican Lens_ does not mention a &quot;vertical&quot; approach to reading in the method section. Therefore, I try to give a vertical reading example on some texts since it can also bring us some discoveries. In the following I will take two poems on the same theme from the second and third issues of _FNSB_, showing the playfulness of the women authors&#39; words and analysing the voices that the women authors want to express through their poems. The second poem is a response (_ciyun_次韵) to the first poem, using the same rhyme scheme (in yellow colour).

读妇女时报有感率成四绝 （承粲女士）[1]

侍儿俏倚斗憨痴，正值环愁钗病时。苦海茫茫谁普济，发明女界自由旗。

脂粉丛中局促生，帘钩低压昼沉沉。恶声半敎甘心忍，那作神州补憾人。

伤心巾帼志销沉，一握莲钩逐紫尘。谁鼓英雌飞大陆，拳翻桎梏炼灵魂。

诵君唱棒吼狮词，三色旗前一健儿。纤手江山扶得住，胭脂宝马任驱驰。

读承粲女士妇女时报有感四绝次韵 （南沙马文蕴）[2]

众香国里太娇痴，花放文明要及时。女界可能齐发达，坤舆一样焕龙旗。

女子无才忝所生，可怜大陆久沉沉。怒狮吼醒金闺梦，知否罗兰也妇人。

月影扶肩夜漏沉，莲钩媿煞蹴红尘。阿谁棒作当头喝，惊起灵魂辅国魂。

如此江山如此词，女权冉许让胡儿。国光家庆胚胎富，欧亚何妨并辔驰。

The authors of both poems are using female pen names or their real names, but their true identities are difficult to verify. What is known is that readers would interact with each other through response poems.

As the most distinctive feature, feminine representations are abundant in the poems, which are connected with powerful expressions. Some of the symbols commonly used in old poetry to refer to women, such as hairpin rings and powder, are given negative connotations here. Instead, the author uses the word _yingci_ 英雌, an innovatively created word derived from hero, to name themselves as heroine. Also, the words such as fist, angry lions, cudgels, are all metaphors with great power. At the same time, they were critical of the ideas of Cheng-Zhu Confucianists. For example, the authors sharply opposed the &#39;talentlessness of women&#39; (女子无才) and foot-binding (莲钩).

In the same spirit as the whole publication, cosmopolitanism is also an important feature of these two poems. They make reference to the tricolour flag, Madame Roland, and the slogan of Euro and Asia in the combined bridle 欧亚并辔. (Somewhat similar to &quot;Asia and Europe in a global context&quot;).
