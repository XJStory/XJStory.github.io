## CORDELL D. K. YEE's *Reinterpreting Traditional Chinese Geographical Maps*

After reading this chapter , I have the following thoughts.

The first point I want to argue is the definition of “map”. The author understands a map as a graphic representation for more than spatial concepts, but also cultural. It contains the functions which may be such as commemorative, religious, educational, or power-demonstrative, etc. But how can man divide it from an artist work? Or, is it necessary to define an explicit boundary between maps and arts? According to the paper, it remains vague. The aesthetic attribute is also seen as one of the maps. In the author’s perspective, it seems like all the paintings containing a spatial meaning can be defined as a map. Although the wide definition is acceptable, I find it partly doubtful. For example, the “Zhao yu tu” (Fig 3,1 in the paper) was a construction plan that was not been finished practically. Is it still a map, if nothing has been constructed according to that? In other words, how much does the quality of being authentic matters to a map? For example, maybe the map drafter intended to draw an artwork to show the vast territory, in doing so, he put some signs in his painting. Since the Chinese word “圖” is not clear and a number of artworks were named after “圖”, treating this kind of paintings with geographic information may be difficult and lead to over-interpretation.   

Secondly, is the concept of map mutual or local? The author tends to prove Chinese maps are way out of the western ideas. But I do find something similar to the European maps. The cultural meaning exists in western maps as well. For example, the “T and O map”, in which Jerusalem is put in the center, reflects on the religious thought. Is “European” equal to mathematical, scientific, accurate, and having no cultural connotation at all? Personally, in terms of mapmaking, I think the eastern and western ways are to some extent mutual.
